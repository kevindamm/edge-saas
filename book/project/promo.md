One of the first things you should do when starting out is build a web presence
that you can link to or mention in marketing or even in conversation.  This can
serve as a point of information that others can forward along on your behalf,
too.  It doesn't have to be complicated, but it should include at least the
mission, information about the current status and a Call-to-Action (usually in
the form of interested parties sharing their email address to receive updates).

Even if you don't have a demo ready yet, having a presence is still a good idea.
It's not just about planting a flag in the ground or showing to others that
You're Serious About This.  It is an effective way to test the market for your
idea and analyze whether it makes sense to continue allocating your time to it.

This tutorial will show you how to build a basic promotional site and host it
for free, with a handful of options each allowing you to link a custom domain
to it, too.
