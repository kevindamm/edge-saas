...TODO lead in


the feature set of what I refer to here as **edge computing**,
platforms that are also known as _serverless_ or _scales-to-zero_ or _demand-based pricing_.
On these platforms, the server resources are provisioned and turned down
dynamically, in response to demand.


## Learning

The topics covered here are broad and complex, dealing with the full stack of
_Sofware as a Service_ and rich feature set of edge computing.  You are likely
to learn something in its contents -- I sure did while writing it! -- and I've
tried to keep it short and sweet and complete at the topmost level of `details`.

Where outside expertise is needed (e.g., drafting the policy terms or handling
payment specifics) these tutorials will not give answers, but the topic will be
mentioned and given enough context to aid in your future conversations.


## Operating

Contained within the text (at its intended completion, WIP) is a stable and
tested basis to build the initial stages of your own software enterprise.  It
is configured to require certain names (like admin email and domain names) and
the existence or creation of security keys.  Although there are other learning
resources online, most of them skip the details like security and policy that
are given coverage here.

I have used all of the technologies here in side projects or experiments, and
most of them in real production environments at scale, and I will try to keep
most of it operational for as long as the [edge-saas repository](https://github.com/kevindamm/edge-saas)
has not been archived.


## Practicing

Even if your goals do not include creating a SaaS company, the material here can
be used in side projects or autodidactic excursions.  The tutorial contents and
the source code can be reused (per terms of [the license](license.md)) in many
applications.  I've attempted to keep each tutorial's content modular but some
files may need to be merged (e.g., tsconfig.json or index-level routing files).


## Contributing

I hope that the content of these tutorials is an improvement on the existing
documentation -- not as a replacement but as a supplement.  Thare are other
great sources of information that I will refer to within deeper `details` of
the content and during conclusive remarks.  If you see areas where you think
this document could improve without straying far beyond its current scope, do
leave a comment here or in GitHub, and note the CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines
when doing so.
