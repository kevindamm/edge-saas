features:
  - title: Low Cost Solutions
    details: Edge servers, when used efficiently, can reduce costs by several orders of magnitude and also lower the cost of ongoing maintenance.  Most of the tutorials here are based on free services, and otherwise aim intentionally to keep costs low.

  - title: Beginner to Expert
    details: These tutorials have been annotated and structured with the intent of revealing more information when more explanation is needed, but remaining short and to the point if collapsible elements are not toggled and links unvisited.

  - title: Security by Design
    details: The tutorials here include explanations of the forethought that went into their design, including attention to security aspects.  Most other tutorials skip over security in the interest of keeping things simple, but really it is as important as any feature.
